## Nevin's Roguelike Tutorials

Welcome! This is a space that contains some of my work on JavaScript Roguelike games. Below is an explanation of each directory within ``games``.

``experimental-rooms``- this contains in-progress code I am working on.

``game-1-drunkard's walk`` - roguelike that uses the Drunkard's walk algorithm.

``game-2-connected-rooms`` - updated version that with a rooms algorithm swapped in.

``tutorial-rooms`` - produces disconnected, labeled rooms for demo and tutorial purposes.

## Credits

The original "Drunkard's walk" roguelike is a fork of a pen created on CodePen.io by Nicola at this URL: [https://codepen.io/ni-kun/pen/jWKWom](https://codepen.io/ni-kun/pen/jWKWom).
